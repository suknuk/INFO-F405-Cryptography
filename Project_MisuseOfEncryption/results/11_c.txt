What is your favorite cartoon? I really like Family Guy!
It's so funny! Even though sometimes it is a little bit stupid,
they often joke about very contraversial topics like politics and religion.
They have so many different styles of episodes! Some about sci-fi stuff (like time-travel),
other are parodies (like a parody of Star Wars). They even have a dog that can speak, his name is Brian.
And there is an evil baby Stewie. Other characters are called Peter, Lois, Chris and Meg.
